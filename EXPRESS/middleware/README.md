# Explain a middleware and create a middleware that checks is user authenticated or not then send data of post

## To test the middleware using Postman:

## Open Postman and make a POST request to http://localhost:{port_no}/api/data with the request body containing valid authentication credentials (username and password).

## If the credentials are correct, you should receive a response with the message "Data posted successfully".

## If the credentials are incorrect or missing, you will receive a response with the "Unauthorized" error.

## To check if the middleware is working, make a GET request to http://localhost:{port_no}/test.

## You should receive a response with the message "Middleware is working" without requiring any authentication.
